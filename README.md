Meteorite-Project
Working on a dataset about meteorite landings provided by the NASA. The project will be divided in numerous sections. The first section is Data Wrangling.

## II.	Data Visualization

### 1. Plotting the data

Assignment:

How do you create a data story? You’ve learned the basics, but the information is probably a bit abstract at this point. Keep in mind that storytelling is an art, so you have to get your imagination bubbling. In this project, you’ll learn some pointers to get those creative juices flowing. In the following sections, we’ll work step-by-step to create your first data story. 

Steps:

1. Ask the following questions and look for the answers using code and plots:
2. Can you count something interesting?
3. Can you find trends (e.g. high, low, increasing, decreasing, anomalies)?
4. Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
5. Can you compare two related quantities?
6. Can you make a scatterplot?
7. Can you make a time-series plot?
